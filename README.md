<h1 align="center"> An Image Classifier on Dog Breeds using Deep Learning </h1>

This project is all about an image classifier to identify dog breeds using deep learning techniques. We reviewed related literature on previous research that used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for dog breed classification. For implementation, we used the DenseNet121 CNN architecture with the Keras API in Python for the model. We also performed data preprocessing, which included cropping, resizing, and augmenting the images. In the methodology section, we explained the training process. This involved cleaning and labeling the dataset, preprocessing images, selecting and fine-tuning the pre-trained DenseNet121 model for the task. It also included optimizing and training the model for 25-50 epochs. The results showed that the model achieved 83.97% accuracy on the training set, indicating DenseNet121's suitability for this task. Our presentation concluded by discussing extending the model to an Anvil web app. We also provided recommendations to further improve accuracy, such as using more data or transfer learning.
